The primary objectives of this project entail the development of a predictive model aimed at forecasting the likelihood of survival for individual passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. Additionally, the project seeks to identify demographic characteristics associated with a higher probability of survival.

Model assessment will be conducted utilizing the test accuracy metric, where the objective is to maximize the accuracy of the model predictions.
